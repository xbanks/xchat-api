XChat (xavier-chat)
===================
_super unique and thoughtful name right?_

This is the backend portion of a small messaging application that I'm putting together. This is more of a learning experience more than anything.

## My "Stack":
- [Finatra](https://twitter.github.io/finatra/) for the http routing
- [SQlite](https://www.sqlite.org) for the testing database
- [Slick](http://slick.lightbend.com/) for the relational mapping

## SQlite
I'm currently using SQlite as a local database, mostly for testing purposes. I'll more than likely move to MySQL or some other database provider when deploying this.

The [SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html) is amazing by the way!


I'd also like to eventually add a frontend and possibly a chat-bot for it.
